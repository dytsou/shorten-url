# Renovate – dependency updates via renovatebot/github-action
#
# The workflow (GitHub Actions) creates the PRs; commits are authored by dytsou
# via gitAuthor in .github/renovate.json. Uses GITHUB_TOKEN so PRs show as from
# github-actions[bot]. Note: PRs created with GITHUB_TOKEN may not trigger other
# workflows (e.g. Test) on push; you can re-run them manually or use a PAT if needed.
